          <h2 className="text-[20px] font-medium text-white/90 mb-4">The Goal</h2>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">The goal of the Snappipay brand design was to create a clear, trustworthy, and scalable identity that makes crypto payments feel fast, simple and reliable in everyday life. The brand needed to reduce perceived complexity, build user confidence, and communicate speed and security—while remaining accessible to a global audience.</p>

        <div className="mt-12">
          <h2 className="text-[20px] font-medium text-white/90 mb-4">My Approach</h2>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">1. Strategy Before Aesthetics</p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">The design process began by aligning the brand with Snappipay’s mission and vision: making crypto practical for everyday payments. I spoke with members of the team and aggregated the general vision that they had for the brand.</p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">Key decisions were grounded in the realities of financial products: users need speed, clarity, and predictability.</p>
        
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight mt-8">2. Brand Personality & Voice</p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">Snappipay was defined as a calm, confident, and dependable brand.</p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">The tone of voice was intentionally:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 list-outside text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">
            <li>Plain and human</li>
            <li>Free of unnecessary crypto jargon</li>
            <li>Focused on outcomes, not technology</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight mt-8">3. Visual Identity System</p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">The visual identity was designed to reinforce trust and ease of use.</p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">I created a system that could be applied across all touchpoints including the website, social media, ads, printed media and product.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-12">
          <h2 className="text-[20px] font-medium text-white/90 mb-4">Brand Strategy & Positioning</h2>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">I held 2 brainstorming sessions with the client to create key brand values. The brand was positioned around one clear promise: <br />
           project management, without the friction. This informed every design decision, from typography to tone of voice. We were able to finalize on brand values, color palette and logo design. <br />
           Rather than competing on feature density, Semplo’s identity emphasizes restraint, clarity, and intentional design.</p>

        <div className="mt-12">
          <h2 className="text-[20px] font-medium text-white/90 mb-4">Results</h2>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">The final brand identity positions Snappipay as a credible, modern, and user-first crypto payment solution.</p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">Key outcomes include:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 list-outside text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">
            <li>A clear and consistent brand system that scales across UI, web, and marketing</li>
            <li>Strong visual trust signals suitable for a financial product</li>
            <li>A calm, confident tone that reduces friction and user anxiety</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-white/80 leading-relaxed tracking-tight">Most importantly, the brand successfully supports Snappipay’s core promise: making crypto payments feel as seamless and reliable as traditional payment methods—while retaining the freedom and flexibility of crypto.</p>
